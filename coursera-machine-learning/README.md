# Coursera: Machine Learning

My work on the programming assignments from [Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) (mid-2016 session).

No [fancy](https://github.com/kaleko/CourseraML) [stuff](https://github.com/faridcher/MachineLearningMOOC), just plain old MATLAB.
